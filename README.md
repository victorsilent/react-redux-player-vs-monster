### Project built with react and redux without follow any tutorial. This time I made by my self :)
#### List of libs used on the project:
*  React
*  Redux
*  ReduxDevTools
*  Bulma

#### Problems with development:
*  The move actions at game generate side effects as dispatch another actions
*  Separate what will be component or what will be container


#### Next steps:
 *  Learn more about react component types like HOC, container, component, presentation and etc...
 *  Learn more about react middleware and how they can help me with dispatch actions inside actions
 *  Create an App that consume an API
